# cordial #

This repository is meant to provide the essential parts of *cordial*, the
*cord* *i*mage an*al*yzer, as it was presented in our [Journal of Neurology][1]
paper; in particular, the graphical user interface to provide manual user input
(landmark, labels for spinal cord and background), the presegmentation
algorithm, as well as the code for surface reconstructions and volume
measurements.

## Current Status and Timeline ##
The code still needs some cleanup and refactoring before making it available.
At present, however, I am finalizing my PhD thesis and thus need to prioritize
differently. I am planning to start pushing to this repository in early June.
